# BlokArmorModifier
This plugin knows damage reduction formulas of Minecraft 1.8. It can change damage reduction amount of armors. For example, you can make golden armors better than diamond armors. Bukkit developers can use these formulas to make modification of 1.8 PvPs. 1.9+ servers can do that easily.
